# Trivia - A React/Redux App

Trivia - A React/Redux App is a widget that ASU will be using for news articles in order to interact with readers.

The widget takes in an object of questions and their answers, then displays them one by one for a user to test their knowledge. Most answers will be found in the article that the widget is embedded into.

Score is being kept. UX adjustments and animations have been added in, thanks to [animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/).

More options will be added soon.
